# Scraping Booking.com to find ideal holiday destinations

## Goal:
We aim to be able to take a list of cities and then find the best hotels for a
vacation.

## Methods:
We first use API to get localisation data for each city, then meteorological
data to select the cities with the best weather for a holiday. After this, we
scrape hotels in each of these locations to present to a user.

We make all this data available on an RDS on AWS.

## Key Findings:
